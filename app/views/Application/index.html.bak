			<b><p>SniffyApp's mission is to provide parents with peace of mind knowing that your children are safe. The reality is children have a tough time coming to their parents about most issues
			in life, due to fear of embarrassment or punishment. Have you ever wondered if your child is having inappropriate conversations? Are you concerned your child may be in a bad relationship 
			but will not give you any details? Are you afraid your child is not where they said they would be? These are the types of questions parents worry about everyday. We know how important it 
			is to keep your child protected and in good hands. Let us help you!
