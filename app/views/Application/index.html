					<h3>What it is?</h3>
					<div class="box_text">
						<p>
						Premonition X(TM) is typical project management software
						but with a twist.  It keeps track of data to understand
						your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">
						schedule, scope and speed(cost) triangle</a> and
						uses this to predict your projects probability of success
						On top of this, a project 
                  		manager can run what-if scenarios.  If a project is currently
                   		at 75% probable to complete on time, he can change any factor in the
                   		project management triangle to get new likelihoods of success.
                   		If you want to have a successful project,
                   		<a href="#">

					<h3>Dashboard</h3>
					<div class="box_text">
					<p>
							For the executive team, we present the "Dashboard" 
   which at a glance tells you which projects are in big trouble(red) and 
   which ones are at risk(yellow) and finally on target in green. It becomes easy
   at a glance to see the state of all projects in your company.  Easily drill down
   into projects to run what-if scenarios and get projects back in the green.

				<h3>Charts:</h3>
				<div class="box_text">
					<p>One example of our prediction charts is the
					<a href="#"> 
						<span style="font-size: 14px; color: red;">"Historical and Future Prediction Chart"</span>
					</a> which shows the historical trend and then draws out the <a href="http://www.construx.com/Page.aspx?cid=1648">
cone of uncertainty</a> of the future.  Your project has a 90% chance of being in the cone.  Another example is our
   <a href="#"> 
	<span style="font-size: 14px; color: red;">"Velocity Trend Chart"</span>
</a> which shows the past weekly velocities of the team and then projects
the range of average velocities you can expect to see in the future.
